Senior Thesis
===
## Overview
My Senior Thesis was about the benefits of modularizing code during the software development process. The project I worked on was based on Soccer data analytics and animation. The project was divided into 3 modules. One module, JSONCreator, would parse the raw data and convert it to a more convenient and human readable JSON format. Another module, DataAnalyzer, was designed to calculated useful statistics (such as Pass Completion %, Shot Accuracy, Goal Scorers, etc.) from the data. Some of the code for that can be seen in the DataAnalyzer directory. The last module was the GUI designed for an interactive experience with the data. Not only could the data be analyzed in real time as the game is played using the DataAnalyzer module, the game could be drawn and the trajectory of the ball could be viewed. I created a rough animation prototype using C# and WinForms. A screenshot of this can be seen below:
